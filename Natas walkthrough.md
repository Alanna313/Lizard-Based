# Natas walkthrough 1-20  
  Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a 
  level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password. Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow 
  obtain that next password and level up
